# OptionViz

OptionViz is a web application designed to visually demonstrate the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, a fundamental concept in finance for pricing options. This app allows users to input parameters such as stock price, strike price, volatility, risk-free rate, and time to expiration to calculate and visualize the option's theoretical price and Greeks.

## Features

- **Option Pricing**: Calculate the theoretical price of a call or put option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula.

- **Graphical Visualization**: View how changes in input parameters affect the option's price and Greeks through interactive graphs.

- **Input Flexibility**: Adjust stock price, strike price, volatility, risk-free rate, and time to expiration to see real-time calculations and visualizations.

- **Responsive Design**: Access the app on any device, with a design that adjusts for the best viewing experience.
